# Prediction using Decision Tree algorithm

DESCRIPTION: 
          This repository contains a Machine Learning (ML) project that uses a Decision Tree classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on the famous Iris dataset. The Decision Tree algorithm is a supervised learning technique widely used for classification tasks. In this project, we'll train the model using the Iris dataset and provide a user-friendly interface to make predictions.

IDE USED: Jupyter notebook.

Programming language used : Python.
